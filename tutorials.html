	<h1>GTA SA Modding - CLEO Coding - How to make a cheat!</h1>

<p>In this tutorial i will demonstrate how with CLEO coding and SannyBuilder you can make custom cheat codes.</p>
<p>
First you'll need SannyBuilder, and ofcourse the CLEO library installed on your copy of San Andreas.</p>
	<li><a href="https://sannybuilder.com/index.html">Download: Sanny Builder</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cleo.li/">Download: CLEO 4</a></li>
	<h2>STEP-BY-STEP</h2>		
<ul>
<li>1. Open SannyBuilder</li>
	<hr><br>
<li>2. Go to File > New</li>
	<hr><br>
<li>3. You should now have a blank page open on the program, good!</li>
	<hr><br>
<li>4. We need to begin our script by declaring what format we want it to be saved in.
At the very top of the page type in<br><br> {$CLEO .cs}<br><br> "Okay so? What does this do?"<br><br> This tells the program what format to compile
your code into when you hit the compile button. In this case it's .cs which stands for CLEO Script.	</li><hr><br>

<li>5. You need to create a thread, name it whatever you like. For instance i decided to name mine 'teles' as i am going
to make a teleportation cheat code.<br><br>e.g: 03A4: name_thread 'teles'</li><hr>	<br>

<li>6. Now we must create a label, to create a label just move down from your thread you created and type :'insertyourthreadsnamehere' (without quotations)
Within labels we put in opcodes, functions and all the code which will make up what will become our script. My label is :teles</li><hr>	<br>

<li>7. Let's get started on the cheat itself, in my case it's going to be a teleport. 
Type:
<br>
	<br>
:teles
	<br>
wait 0
	<br>
if
	<br>
0ADC: test_cheat "VENTURASHEREICOME" 
	<br>
then
	<br>
else_jump @teles
	<br>

	<br>
What this is basically saying is if the player doesn't test the cheat string ("VENTURASHEREICOME") then just stay in the loop waiting for
the moment the player types it.</li><hr>	<br>

<li>8. Let's expand our code now we have a condition in place.<br>
<br>
Add:
<br><br>
Actor.PutAt($PLAYER_ACTOR, X coordinate, Y coord, Z coord)<br>            
03E5: show_text_box "CHEAT ACTIVATED"<br>
end<br>
<br>
Now our overall code is basically saying wait for the player to test the string, if the string IS tested then place the player ($PLAYER_ACTOR, this is the players global handle) at the specified coordinates and show a text box. The text box will appear in caps, but if you have the GXTHook plugin and create a text id with your own custom text, it won't be case sensitive 

To figure out what coordinates your teleport is going to be you must run GTA SA, head to your location.
ALT+TAB out of the game and open SannyBuilder, hit CTRL+ALT+1 and it will open a dialog box showing
your coordinates, hit copy and paste the coordinates in the <br>Actor.PutAt($PLAYER_ACTOR, _______,______,______)</li><hr>	<br>

<li>9. Now compile your code by hitting the compile button, which is two buttons from the left of the options cog.
Make sure you compile the file into your CLEO folder!</li><hr>	<br>

<li>10. Test the cheat and enjoy! You can edit the outcomes of inputting the string to make your own cheats if you followed this guide.</li>
